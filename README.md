## README

Bitcoin is a decentralised virtual currency. It has many exchange markets on which you can buy or sell BTC. This app shows the history of some of these markets.

For more information on bitcoin, checkout <https://bitcoin.org>

Using this visualiser is pretty straight forward. Select a currency, a market and optionally a date range. The chart should load pretty soon after.

There are some other settings available for the chart. You can optionally show a grid, upper/lower bars, or zoom in on the last 25% of the available date range.
